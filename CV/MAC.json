    "desiredJobDescription": "My ideal job is one where I can focus on building robust, scalable backend systems while collaborating with a team that values clarity, ownership, and engineering excellence. I enjoy refining designs, discussing architectural decisions, and making code better — not just functional, but elegant.\n\nI thrive in international, remote-first teams with well-structured processes and purposeful communication. I appreciate when stand-ups stay focused, decisions are data-driven, and developers have a real voice in shaping the product.\n\nWhile I have no issue mentoring or leading when needed, my core passion lies in hands-on coding and problem solving. I find joy in turning complex requirements into clean solutions, especially in event-driven and microservice-based architectures.\n\nI also believe in continuous learning — whether it’s through courses, certifications, or just exploring new tools and paradigms. The right environment for me is one where growth is not just encouraged, but expected.",
    "goodPractices": "I care a lot about writing clean, understandable code. \n\nI usually apply design patterns when they make sense, and I’m a big fan of hexagonal architecture since it helps keep things tidy and easy to test. I enjoy designing microservices that talk to each other through events, and I write integration tests that catch issues before they reach production.\n\nI’m also someone who likes to bring technical ideas to the table. Finding simple, solid solutions is one of the things I enjoy most about backend work."
